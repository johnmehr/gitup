.Sh NAME
.Nm gitup.conf
.Nd Configuration file for gitup(1).
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file stores configuration options and controls the behavior of gitup(1).
.Pp
This file contains an arbitrary number of sections, each of which can be passed
as the first command line argument to gitup(1).
Within each section, individual parameters are stored as key/value pairs.
.Pp
Lines beginning with a '#' are ignored.
.Pp
Additional, user defined sections can be added to
.Nm
as needed.
.Pp
When gitup(1) is run, the options in the
.Pa defaults
section are assigned first,
followed by the options in the desired section (each of which will supersede
any previously assigned default values), followed lastly by any command line
options.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are currently supported by
.Nm
and can be added to any section:
.Bl -tag -width "work_directory"
.It Cm host
The hostname/IP address of the server.
.It Cm port
The port on the server to connect to.
.It Cm repository
The repository to use.
.It Cm branch
The repository branch to use.
.It Cm target
The local directory to store your copy of the repository.
.It Cm ignores
An array of directories in the local tree that should be ignored only when
deleting files.  Any changes to upstream files in these directories will be
pulled down and merged.
.It Cm verbosity
How much of the transfer details to display.  0 = no output, 1 = show only
names of the updated files, 2 = also show commands sent to the server and
additional debugging information.
.It Cm work_directory
The location to load/save the known remote files list.

.Sh EXAMPLES
With the following configuration options defined in
.Nm
.Pp
{
.br
    "defaults" : {
.br
        "host"           : "github.com",
.br
        "port"           : "443",
.br
        "verbosity"      : "1",
.br
        "work_directory" : "/var/db/gitup",
.br
    },
.Pp
    "ports" : {
.br
        "repository" : "/freebsd/freebsd-ports.git",
.br
        "branch"     : "master",
.br
        "target"     : "/usr/ports",
.br
        "ignores"    : [
.br
            "distfiles",
.br
            "packages",
.br
        ],
.br
    },
.br
}
.Pp
Executing:
.Pp
.Dl "gitup ports"
.Pp
from the command line would result in a copy of the freebsd-ports/master branch
downloaded to /usr/ports.
If /usr/ports does not exist, the repository is cloned.
If it does exist and /var/db/gitup/ports exists, the latest commit to the
repository is pulled down and the contents of /usr/ports/distfiles and
/usr/ports/packages are ignored when removing stale files and directories.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "%%CONFIG_FILE_PATH%%"
.It %%CONFIG_FILE_PATH%%
Default location of the
.Nm
configuration file.
