.Sh NAME
.Nm gitup
.Nd A minimalist, dependency-free program to clone/pull git repositories.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Cm section
.Op Fl ckV
.Op Fl h Ar commit checksum
.Op Fl t Ar tag
.Op Fl u Ar pack file
.Op Fl v Ar verbosity
.Op Fl w Ar commit checksum
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a minimalist, dependency-free program used to clone or synchronize a local copy of a git repository.  It is not intended to be a full-featured replacement for the devel/git port, but rather, is intended to provide a convenient way for users to update FreeBSD source files without having to install devel/git (and all of its related dependencies) and without the substantial disk overhead that normally accompany local git repositories.
.Sh OPTIONS
Configuration options are stored in GITUPCONF and are grouped into commonly used sections (additional custom sections can be added to this file).  The following command line options can be used to override the default and/or section values:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl c
Force
.Nm
to clone the repository.
.It Fl h
The "have" commit checksum of the repository to use.  Only needed when importing a pack file generated by the official git client.
.It Fl k
Save a copy of the pack data.
.It Fl t
Fetch the commit referenced by the specified tag.
.It Fl u
Skip the download of the pack data and use the specified file instead.
.It Fl v
How verbose the output should be (0 = no output, 1 = show only names of the updated files/folders, 2 = also show commands sent to the server and additional debugging information).
.It Fl V
Display the version number and exit.
.It Fl w
The "want" commit checksum of the repository to retrieve.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "GITUPCONF"
.It GITUPCONF
Default location of the
.Nm
configuration file.
.It /var/tmp/gitup
Default location where
.Nm
stores its lists of known files.  The files stored here are used during subsequent runs to reconstruct the local repository state and confirm that the local tree is intact.
.El
.Sh CAVEATS
Because
.Nm
neither uses nor updates the .git folder, it is not a drop-in replacement for the official git client.
.Nm
should only be used on repositories originally cloned with the official git client if there is no intention to ever use the official git client on that local repository again.
.Pp
To keep its footprint as small as possible,
.Nm
doesn't retain pack files downloaded from the repository (unless explicitly instructed to do so) and doesn't use a saved pack file (unless explicitly instructed to do so).
.Nm
relies on the known remote files lists stored in /var/tmp/gitup and the current state of the local repository to reconstruct data that would be stored in the pack file.  Discrepancies in the local repository will be flagged as errors and will need to be manually restored before
.Nm
can update the local repository.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Using the configuration options for commonly used repositories/branches stored in GITUPCONF, to clone/pull a copy of the most recent revision of stable/12:
.Pp
.Dl "gitup stable"
.Pp
To retrieve a copy of freebsd-ports at commit 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567:
.Pp
.Dl "gitup ports -w 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567"
